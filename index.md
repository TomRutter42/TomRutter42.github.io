### Meta-Analysis of Present-Bias Estimation Using Convex Time Budgets
with Taisuke Imai and Colin F. Camerer. The Economic Journal (forthcoming)

We examine 220 estimates of the present-bias parameter from~28 articles using the Convex Time Budget protocol. The literature shows that people are on average present-biased, but estimates exhibit substantial heterogeneity across studies. There is evidence of modest selective reporting in the direction of overreporting present-bias. The primary source of heterogeneity is the type of reward, either monetary or non-monetary, but this effect is weakened after correcting for selective reporting. In studies using monetary rewards, the delay until the issue of the reward associated with the "current" time period influences estimates of the present-bias parameter.

### The Effectiveness of a Neighbor-to-Neighbor Get-Out-the-Vote Program: Evidence from the 2017 Virginia State Elections
with Cassandra Handan-Nader, Daniel E. Ho, and Alison Morantz. Journal of Experimental Political Science (forthcoming)

We analyze the results of a neighbor-to-neighbor, grassroots get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drive in Virginia, in which unpaid volunteers were encouraged to contact at least three nearby registered voters who were likely co-partisans yet relatively unlikely to vote in the 2017 state election. We find that the volunteers in the original program design drove a statistically significant 2.3% increase in turnout, which was concentrated in the first voter pair assigned to each volunteer.
